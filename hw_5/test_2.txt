The mechanics of cached_property() are somewhat different from property().
A regular property blocks attribute writes unless a setter is defined.
In contrast, a cached_property allows writes.
The cached_property decorator only runs on lookups and only when an attribute of the same name doesnâ€™t exist.
When it does run, the cached_property writes to the attribute with the same name. Subsequent attribute
reads and writes take precedence over the cached_property method and it works like a normal attribute.
The cached value can be cleared by deleting the attribute. This allows the cached_property method to run again.
